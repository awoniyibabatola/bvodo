===============================================

Subject: Duffel Stays Migration Work Plan - Bvodo Platform
Date: October 26, 2025

Dear Team,

I've completed the comprehensive analysis and work plan for migrating from Amadeus to Duffel Stays API for the Bvodo platform.

===============================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
===============================================

CURRENT STATE:
- Amadeus hotel search is functional
- Amadeus booking API is NOT implemented (marked as TODO in code)
- Database schema fully designed and ready
- Frontend pages fully built (search + details)

TARGET STATE:
- Full Duffel Stays integration (search, quotes, bookings)
- Unified platform with existing Duffel flights
- Better data quality and validation
- Integrated payment flows

TIMELINE: 4-6 weeks
RISK LEVEL: Low-Medium (familiar API patterns from flights)

===============================================
WHY DUFFEL STAYS?
===============================================

COMPARISON: Amadeus vs Duffel Stays

1. API WORKFLOW:
   Amadeus: Direct booking (no validation step)
   Duffel: Search → Rates → Quote → Book (validation built-in)
   WINNER: Duffel (prevents payment failures)

2. INVENTORY:
   Amadeus: ~700,000 properties (GDS-focused)
   Duffel: Millions of properties (aggregated)
   WINNER: Duffel

3. PAYMENT METHODS:
   Amadeus: External hotel payment
   Duffel: Integrated balance + card payments
   WINNER: Duffel (works with your Stripe setup)

4. DATA QUALITY:
   Amadeus: Limited photos (need Google Places)
   Duffel: Comprehensive photos included
   WINNER: Duffel

5. TESTING:
   Amadeus: Often returns no offers in test mode
   Duffel: Dedicated test hotels at coordinates -24.38, -128.32
   WINNER: Duffel

6. CONSISTENCY:
   Amadeus: Separate API from flights
   Duffel: Same API as your existing Duffel flights
   WINNER: Duffel (unified platform)

===============================================

Verify search endpoint works
Test all API calls with Postman/curl

ACTION 4: Schedule Kickoff Meeting
- Review this work plan with dev team
- Assign responsibilities (backend, frontend, QA)
- Set up project tracking (Jira, Trello, etc.)
- Schedule weekly check-ins

ACTION 5: Create Development Branch
git checkout -b feature/duffel-stays-integration
