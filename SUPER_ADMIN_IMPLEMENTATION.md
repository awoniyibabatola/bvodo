## Usage Examples

### Creating a Super Admin User

Super admins are not created through normal registration. They must be created manually in the database or through a special seed script:

```javascript
// Example: Creating super admin via Prisma
await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    organizationId: 'some-org-id', // Can use any org or create special "Platform" org
    email: 'superadmin@bvodo.com',
    passwordHash: await hashPassword('secure-password'),
    firstName: 'Super',
    lastName: 'Admin',
    role: 'super_admin',
    status: 'active',
    emailVerified: true,
    emailVerifiedAt: new Date(),
  },
});
```

### API Request Examples

**Get Platform Stats:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/v1/super-admin/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>"
```

curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/super-admin/organizations?search=acme&page=1&limit=20" \

```

**Allocate Credits (Add $10,000):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/super-admin/organizations/org-123/credits/allocate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 10000,
    "operation": "add"
  }'
```

**Set Total Credits to $50,000:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/super-admin/organizations/org-123/credits/allocate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "operation": "set"
  }'
```

**Reduce Credits by $5,000:**
